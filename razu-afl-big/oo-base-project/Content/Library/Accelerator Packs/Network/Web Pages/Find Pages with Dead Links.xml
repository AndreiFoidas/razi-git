The flow visits the web pages in the baseURL input and, if it is allowed (recursionDepth &gt; 0), will also visit in a recursive manner the URLs that are referred (in hyperlinks) by the previously visited pages. This process repeats upto a certain level of recursion specified using the recursionDepth input - this prevents the flow from crawling endlessly. The flow will only test a URL a single time. The tested URLs are classified by the flow as good, slow or bad and passed in the corresponding results.\n\nInputs\:\n    baseURL - The list of URLs to be tested. Semicolon (;) is used as delimiter for this list.\n    recurse - Specifies whether the crawler will recurse. If set to "Yes" it will recurse to a depth specified by the recursionDepth numeric input. If set to "No" the crawler will not recurse regardless of the recursionDepth input.\nValid values\: Yes, No.\nDefault value\: No.\n    recursionDepth - The depth to which the crawler will continue to test linked pages.\nDefault value\: no recursion limit - this means that the crawler is allowed to recurse endlessly if the recurse input is "Yes".\nValid values\: natural numbers.    \n    timeout - How many milliseconds a page is given to respond before it is considered slow.\nDefault value\: 0 - this means that there is no response timeout and a page is considered "good" if it responds successfully.\n    allowedDomains - A semicolon delimited list of domains that the flow is allowed to crawl through. This does not need to include the domain of baseURL.\n    username - The username to use for authentication to the URLs.\n    password - The password to use for basic authentication to the URLs.\n    proxy - A proxy to use when accessing the URLs.\n    proxyPort - A port on the proxy to connect to.\n    proxyUsername - A username to use when connecting to the proxy.\n    proxyPassword - A password to use when connecting to the proxy.\n    followRedirects - Specifies whether or not the "get" command should automatically follow redirects.\nDefault value\: false.\n    trustAllRoots - Enables weak security over SSL. An SSL certificate is trusted even if no trusted CA issued it.\nDefault value\: false.\n    trustKeystore - URL of the truststore file or local path to it (e.g. %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts). It may be empty if HTTPS server authentication is not to be used.\n    trustPassword - Password to unlock the truststore.\n    characterSet - The characterSet for HTTP Get request and response.\nDefault value\: UTF-8.\n    keystore - URL of the keystore file or local path to it (e.g. %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts).

The operation also accepts including query parameters in the url (Example\: http\://hostname\:80/page.asp?parameterName1\=parameterValue1&amp;parameterName2\=parameterValue2). If you specify the same query parameter both through the "queryNamesList" and through the url input, then the value from the "queryValuesList" list will be used and not the one included in the url.\n2.

The value should be false to send the email in plain text format.\n\nResponses\:\nsuccess - The user was notified.\nfailure - Notification failed.\n\nAs mentioned above, some inputs are required for certain types of notification methods. In order to schedule a flow that in turn uses this flow, all of the required fields for the given notification method must be supplied, or else the flow will not be able to execute to completion. For example, if "notifyMethod" is "File", then the "destination" input must also be specified.\n&lt;/pre&gt;

Default value\: false.\nuserAgent - If the HTTP header USER_AGENT needs to be overridden, pass in the value here.\ncharacterSet - the characterSet for HTTP Get request and response. Default is UTF-8.\ntrustAllRoots - If true, enables weak security over SSL. A SSL certificate is trusted even if no trusted CA issued it.Default value\: false.\nkeystore - URL of the keystore file or local path to it (e.g. %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts). It may be empty if HTTPS client  authentication is not to be used.\nkeystorePassword - Password to unlock the keystore.\ntrustKeystore - URL of the truststore file or local path to it (e.g. %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts).

Example\: parameterName1,parameterName2 \nqueryValuesList - A list containing the values of query parameters that should be used for the request. Example\: parameterValue1,parameterValue2\ndelimiter - A delimiter that separates the elements in the names and values lists. Default value\: , (comma).\n\nResponses\:\nsuccess - web page was retrieved in less than timeout milliseconds.\nfailure - web page could not be retrieved.\ndiagnosed - The web page was retrieved, but it took more than timeout milliseconds.\n\nReturns\:\nThe number of milliseconds it took to retrieve the page.\n\nExtra Results\:\nurls - A semicolon delimited list of links from the given url.\n\nNotes\:\n1. You can use keytool to import an ssl certificate in a keystore. For example to import a certificate in the Java cacerts keystore you should run\: keytool -import -file c\:/../&lt;your_cert&gt;.cer -alias &lt;your_alias&gt; -keystore %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts -keystorepass changeit. If the keystore does not exist the command will try to create a new one containing only your certificate.\n2. You can use keytool to create a certificate chain through the following command\: \n   keytool -genkey -dname "cn\=Mark Jones, ou\=JavaSoft, o\=Sun, c\=US" \n      -alias business -keypass kpi135 -keystore C\:\\working\\mykeystore \n      -storepass ab987c -validity 180\nIt creates a certificate chain in a new keystore containing only one certificate. This command is useful in case of ssl client authentication because the KeyManager ignores any certificates which are not included in a certificate chain.\n3. If trustAllRoots \= false and trustKeystore is empty, the operation will try to use the default trust store with the password "changeit". (i.e.  %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts) \n4. If you need to specify the request header fields, consider using the "headerNamesList" and "headerValuesList" inputs. The operation also accepts hidden inputs whose names begin with "header_", but this deprecated. You can add multiple headers.  For example, add an input name called "header_Content-Type" with a value as "text/html" and/or an input name called "header_Content-Length" with a value as "348".  The operation will strip off the "header_" prefix from the input name first, and the "Content-Type" and/or "Content-Length" header should be created with the value you specify. If you specify the same header both through the "headerNamesList" and through a "header_" hidden input, then the value from the "headerValuesList" list will be used and not the hidden input's value.\n5. If you need to specify query parameters when making the request, consider using the \u201CqueryNamesList\u201D and \u201CqueryValuesList\u201D inputs. The operation also accepts including query parameters in the url (Example\: http\://hostname\:80/page.asp?parameterName1\=parameterValue1&amp;parameterName2\=parameterValue2). If you specify the same query parameter both through the "queryNamesList" and through the url input, then the value from the "queryValuesList" list will be used and not the one included in the url.\n6. Currently, the only supported application server when using form-based authentication is Apache Tomcat.\n&lt;/pre&gt;

This response will only be returned once per iteration through the list, a subsequent call to the Iterator will restart the Iteration through the list.\nfailure - failed to process the list.\n\nNote\: Where the iterator is in the list is tracked by each step's unique id. Therefore you can iterate on the same list from multiple steps simultaneously.\n\nWARNING\: Any step that will use the results of this Iterator operation will, by default, attempt to assign that step's inputs from a flow variable. If this is left checked, then the first element of the iterator will be used for every cycle of iteration.

Default value is set to false.\nproxy - a proxy to use when accessing the baseURL.\nproxyPort - a port on the proxy to connect to.\nproxyUsername - a username to use when connecting to the proxy.\nproxyPassword - a password to use when connecting to the proxy.\nencodeURL - Perform URL encoding. This is a boolean input. If a non-boolean value is specified, it will take the default value. Default value\: false.\nuserAgent - If the HTTP header USER_AGENT needs to be overridden, pass in the value here.\ncharacterSet - The characterSet for HTTP Get request and response. Default is UTF-8.\ntrustAllRoots - If true, enables weak security over SSL. A SSL certificate is trusted even if no trusted CA issued it.Default value\: false.\nkeystore - URL of the keystore file or local path to it (e.g. %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts). It may be empty if HTTPS client  authentication is not to be used.\nkeystorePassword - Password to unlock the keystore.\ntrustKeystore - URL of the truststore file or local path to it (e.g. %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts). It may be empty if HTTPS server authentication is not to be used.\ntrustPassword - Password to unlock the truststore.\nheaderNamesList - A list containing the names of headers that should be used for the request. Example\: Accept,Content-Type\nheaderValuesList - A list containing the values of headers that should be used for the request. Example\: text/plain,application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nqueryNamesList - A list containing the names of query parameters that should be used for the request. Example\: parameterName1,parameterName2 \nqueryValuesList - A list containing the values of query parameters that should be used for the request. Example\: parameterValue1,parameterValue2\ndelimiter - A delimiter that separates the elements in the names and values lists. Default value\: , (comma).\n\nResults\:\nreferencing - Referencing URLs\n\nResponses\:\nsuccess - Web pages successfully crawled.\nfailure - something went wrong.\n\nReturns\:\nA semicolon delimited list of urls that reference members of references.\n\nNote\:\n1. If you need to specify query parameters when making the request, consider using the \u201CqueryNamesList\u201D and \u201CqueryValuesList\u201D inputs. The operation also accepts including query parameters in the url (Example\: http\://hostname\:80/page.asp?parameterName1\=parameterValue1&amp;parameterName2\=parameterValue2). If you specify the same query parameter both through the "queryNamesList" and through the url input, then the value from the "queryValuesList" list will be used and not the one included in the url.\n2. Currently, the only supported application server when using form-based authentication is Apache Tomcat.\n&lt;/pre&gt;
