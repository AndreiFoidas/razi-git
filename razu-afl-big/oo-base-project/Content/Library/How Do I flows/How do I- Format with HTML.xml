BEFORE TESTING OR RUNNING THIS FLOW\:\nIn this flow, you will specify a file to be used for appending the HTML. For the flow to succeed, you need to make sure that this file does not already exist. If it does exist, delete it before you run the flow.\n
9d8c9268-34f6-45fd-8932-097ea9a6d310.1bc2fcf2-04c9-4156-b867-501eadd7c156.callout=STEP 5. The "Write to File" step retrieves the HTML table created by the  "HTML Table Formatter" step and appends it to the  file you specified in the previous "Write to File" step.

In this flow, the "source" input gets its value from the user by means of a user prompt.\n"delimiter" - The delimiter placed between the files and folders in the list. The default is a comma (,). In this flow, the delimiter input gets its value from the constant ",".\n\nStep Results\:\nThe list of files and folders are retrieved from the specified folder. In this flow, the results are assigned to the flow variable "tableReady" which is defined on the Results tab. \n\nExtra Results\:\n"count" - This is the number of files and folders in the "source" folder.\n\nStep Responses\:\n"success" - The step was able to retrieve the list of files and folders from the specified folder. The flow transitions to the "HTML Table Formatter" step.\n"failure" - The step could not retrieve the list of files and folders from the specified folder.

In this flow, the "source" input gets its value from the user by means of a user prompt. \n"contents" - The contents to write to the file. In this flow, the "contents" input gets its value from the "HTML String Formatter" step\u2019s results.\noverwrite - specifies whether to overwrite the file or to append to it. By default, the used value is true. Accepted values\: true, false or the empty string. If this is left empty, the file will be overwritten.\n\nStep Results\:\nThe formatted HTML string  is appended to the specified file.\n\nStep Responses\:\n"success" -The step was able to append the formatted HTML string to the specified file. The flow transitions to the "FS Get Children" step.\n"failure" - The step was unable to append  the formatted HTML string tothe specified file.

In this case, the flow formats a text string as HTML and appends it to the file you specify. Next it retrieves a list of the files and folders from the  folder you specify and formats this list into an HTML table, appending it to the previously-specified file. You can use HTML formatting to display the data retrieved from an operation or flow on a page in a Web browser. \n
