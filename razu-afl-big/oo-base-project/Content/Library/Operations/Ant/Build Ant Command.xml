Each time that this operation\nis called it places the value of the current array element into the Result\noutput and advances the iterator to the array element.\n\nThe JSON format is basically a way to encode arrays and other values using\nJavaScript notation.  For arrays, this means that the values need to be\nsurrounded by square brackets, and each element in the array can be a string\n(which needs surrounding quotes), a number, true, false, null, or a nested array\nor object.  Commas are always used as delimiters between array elements, and\nthey can appear within string elements without confusion.  For example, the\nfollowing is a simple JSON array\:\n   [ "cat", "dog", "horse" ]\nNote that the equivalent OO list would be \n   cat,dog,horse\nThe benefits of JavaScript arrays are that delimiters are fixed and cannot be\nconfused with data, and that complex nesting of arrays and objects are\nsupported.  The description of the enclosing folder, /Library/Utility\nOperations/Container/JavaScript Objects has more examples, and the JSON format\nis described completely at http\://www.json.org.\n\nModifying the contents of the array during iteration is not generally supported,\nbut will be safe as long as the affected item(s) are beyond the current position\nof the iterator.  The iterator keeps track of where it is in the array by\nposition.  If items are added or removed to the list in a position preceding the\niterator, it may cause the iterator to return results that are not obvious.  For\nexample, if the array contains [ "a", "b", "c" ] and the iterator is positioned\non the second element, "b" and the first element is removed, then the iterator\nwill now be at the last element in the list, "c".\n\nThere is currently a limitation that a flow can only have one of these array\niterator steps active at a time without causing possible conflicts.  In other\nwords, if you need to iterate through a nested array, you will should use a\nsub-flow to process the inner array.  You may have two or more of these array\niterators in the same flow as long as each iterator reaches the end of its array\nbefore the next one begins.\n\nInputs\n\n   array\n      The JavaScript array that will be iterated through.  The operation will\n      return a failure if the array is not a JavaScript array; a normal OO list\n      is NOT a JavaScript array.\n\nResponses\n\n   has more\n      The iterator has not yet reached the end of the array. The Result output\n      will be populated with the value of the current element in the array, and\n      the iterator will advance to the next element in the array.\n\n   no more\n      The iterator has reached the end of the array, and there is no more data\n      to return.  The iterator will become undefined after this call, which\n      basically will reset it so that if called again, this operation will begin\n      another iteration at the beginning of the array.\n\n   failure\n      There was some error in iterating through the list, and the Result output\n      will contain information about the error.  This will occur if the input\n      array is not a valid JavaScript array.  For example, if presented with a\n      common list value such as a,b,c it will fail because it lacks the\n      enclosing brackets and the quotes around each string element.

When incorporating this operation into a flow,\n      you should assign a meaningful result value from this field.
