The valid values are listed below in precedence order-\n- Process \: The execution policy affects only the current session (the current Windows PowerShell process). The execution policy is stored in the $env\:PSExecutionPolicyPreference environment variable, not in the registry, and it is deleted when the session is closed. You cannot change the policy by editing the variable value.\n\n- CurrentUser \: The execution policy affects only the current user. It is stored in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry subkey. \n\n- LocalMachine \: The execution policy affects all users on the current computer. It is stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry subkey. It is the default policy when setting an execution policy. \n\n- MachinePolicy \: Execution policy set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer.\n\n- UserPolicy \: Execution policy set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer.\n\nThe policy that takes precedence is effective in the current session, even if a more restrictive policy was set at a lower level of precedence.\n</pre>
