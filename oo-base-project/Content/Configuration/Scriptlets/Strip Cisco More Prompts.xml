  <descriptionCdata><![CDATA[84136ad4-5961-4cc5-85d3-fdcd945a2591.description=Analyzes the input as a multiline string.  If a line starts with "--More--" it is omitted from the result otherwise it is included in the result.\nNOTE\: This scriptlet should be considered deprecated. Removing the More prompts from the output of a Cisco router with a scriptlet filter \ncan allow illegal xml characters to pass through to a web browser, plus it's just more efficient to not have the ---More--- prompts in the \noutput to begin with. \n\nAll Cisco commands should be prefixed with the following now\:\n\nexpect (.*\\s*)*>\nsend terminal length 0\n\nThis will prevent the ---More--- prompts from appearing in the output, and remove the need for this scriptlet
